# Write a function N_SUM to find the sum of the integers from 1 to N. 
# The value N will be passed to the procedure in $a0 and the result 
# will be returned in the $v0 register. Write a MIPS-32 assembly language 
# main program that will call the Sum function and print the result. 
#Run your program using MARS for the following values of N: 9, 32, and 777.
