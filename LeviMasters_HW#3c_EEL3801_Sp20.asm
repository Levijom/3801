# Write a complete MIPS-32 assembly language program including 
# data declarations that uses a function “Eval_Z” which evaluates 
# the following expression Z = X - 3 (Y / 8 + 125). 
# Assume that caller program passes the values of X and Y to 
# the function using registers $a0 and $a1 respectively while the result 
# of executing the function is returned to the caller in register $v0. 
# The caller program should display the result on the console 
# preceded by an appropriate message. Run your program using MARS. 
# Consider the following integer values 
# (X1, Y1) = (100, 24) and  (X1, Y1) = (100, 21)
